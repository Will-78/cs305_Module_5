I am working to make a program that will run multiple robots updating and tracking their movements based off the user's input. Once the input has ceased the robots' information will be shown to the user of the program.
Currently I am in the last stages of writing the code and hope to wrap up the program within the next two weeks.
I decided to use the GNU General Public Liscense so that the work can be freely accessed and freely distributed, in addition to recieving source code.
